   - Fixed image upload handling to store in Supabase Storage

2. **Document Upload for Hotel Admins**
   - Created a new component for document uploads
   - Added document metadata tracking (tags, languages, document types)
   - Created Supabase Storage integration for secure document storage
   - Prepared metadata structure for future Pinecone vector database integration

3. **Database Changes**
   - Added a `profiles` table to store extended user profile data
   - Added metadata and vector_id columns to the documents table
   - Created Row Level Security (RLS) policies to secure user data
   - Set up storage buckets for avatars and hotel documents

## Files Modified
