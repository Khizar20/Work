# Database & TypeScript Integration Update

This document explains the changes made to fix the TypeScript errors in the project and ensure proper integration with the Supabase database schema.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Database Schema Types

We updated the `database.types.ts` file to include two important table definitions:

- **Profiles Table**: Added complete type definitions for the user profiles table where we store extended user information.
- **Documents Table**: Updated the documents table definition to include the new `metadata` and `vector_id` fields that were added in the migration.

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Errors in Supabase API Functions

- Fixed type errors in the `getUserProfile` function to properly handle database responses
- Fixed null/undefined type issues by changing `null` returns to `undefined` where needed
- Updated the `uploadProfileImage` function to use the correct types

### 3. Enhanced Document Upload Functionality

- Added proper error handling for document metadata in the `hotel-documents.ts` file
- Added the `Json` type import to ensure type safety when handling metadata
- Fixed type errors in document response mapping

### 4. Added Hotel ID Lookup Function

- Created a new `getUserHotelId` function to retrieve the hotel ID for the current user
- Updated the document upload component to use this function
- This ensures that documents are properly linked to the user's hotel

### 5. Added Document List Component

- Created a `DocumentsList` component to display documents uploaded by the hotel admin
- Enhanced the UI/UX for document management
- Properly integrated with the document retrieval API

## Next Steps

1. **Test the API Integration**: Test all the Supabase API functions to ensure they work correctly with your database schema.
2. **Implement Document Search**: Continue implementing the Pinecone vector database integration for document search.
3. **Document Versioning**: Consider adding document versioning functionality for better document management.

## Note on TypeScript Best Practices

When working with Supabase, it's important to:

1. Ensure your `database.types.ts` file accurately reflects your database schema
2. Use proper TypeScript types for all API responses and requests
3. Handle null and undefined values appropriately, especially when mapping data
4. Use TypeScript's type guards to ensure type safety when working with complex data structures

The changes made should ensure type safety throughout the application while maintaining full compatibility with the Supabase database schema.
