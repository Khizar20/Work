-- Note: Storage policies are handled separately through the Supabase dashboard or storage API
-- These are the equivalent policies for the hotel_documents storage bucket:

/*
Storage Bucket: hotel_documents

Policy 1: "Hotel admins can upload documents"
Operation: INSERT
Target roles: authenticated
USING expression:
bucket_id = 'hotel_documents' AND 
EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM hotel_admins 
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
)

Policy 2: "Hotel admins can read their hotel documents"
Operation: SELECT
Target roles: authenticated
USING expression:
bucket_id = 'hotel_documents' AND
EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM hotel_admins ha
  WHERE ha.user_id = auth.uid()
)

Policy 3: "Hotel admins can update their documents"
Operation: UPDATE
Target roles: authenticated
USING expression: (same as Policy 2)

Policy 4: "Hotel admins can delete their documents"
Operation: DELETE
Target roles: authenticated
USING expression: (same as Policy 2)
*/

-- ============================================================================
-- VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Test query to verify RLS policies are working
-- Run this after the policies are created to test:

/*
-- Check if current user has hotel admin access
SELECT 
  ha.id as hotel_admin_id,
  ha.hotel_id,
  ha.role,
  h.name as hotel_name
FROM hotel_admins ha

WHERE ha.user_id = auth.uid();

-- Test document insert permissions
-- This should return true if the user can insert documents
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM hotel_admins ha
      WHERE ha.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND ha.hotel_id = '8a1e6805-9253-4dd5-8893-0de3d7815555'  -- Replace with actual hotel_id
    ) 
    THEN 'User can insert documents for this hotel'
    ELSE 'User cannot insert documents for this hotel'
  END as permission_check;
*/

-- ============================================================================
-- GRANT PERMISSIONS TO authenticated ROLE
-- ============================================================================

-- Ensure the authenticated role has the necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON documents TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON hotel_admins TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON hotels TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON profiles TO authenticated;
